# NYC Airbnb Analytics

This notebook explores a dataset of Airbnb NYC listings to gain insights on pricing, availability, and more across various neighborhoods.
The analysis uses libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, GeoPandas, and more for data cleaning/wrangling and visualization.

Clear process outlined in the notebook itself.
